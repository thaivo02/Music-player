Your eyes are lighting flames
Like lights along the way
The beautiful ones light up the world
So we don't feel invisible
When I'm made for, not unbreakable
We're all lost in the night
Love is chemical, hearts are flammable
When we turn off the lights
The ritual fires
They light up and guide us
Shining inside us
Calling all la-la-la
The ritual fires
The falling of triumph
A beautiful riot
In all of us, la-la-la, la-la-la
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
They light up and guide us
The ritual fires
La-la-la
The lights call up our name
Tonight, we're all the same
And we are the sun, light up the world
The darkness is doing some ritual
When I'm made for, not unbreakable
We're just lost in the night
Love is chemical, hearts all flammable
So just turn off the lights
The ritual fires
They light up and guide us
Shining like diamonds
Calling all la-la-la
The ritual fires
The falling of triumphs
A beautiful riot
In all of us, la-la-la, la-la-la
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
They light up and guide us
The ritual fires
La-la-la
