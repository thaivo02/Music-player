I heard a million tales before I came to you
One after the other said, "Time's the only cure"
When love is forever gone
It disappeared like stars at the dawn
And every road that I've been on
It leads me back to you (yeah)
It leads me back to you
I walked a million miles before I came to you
Heaven wide above my head, sand beneath my shoes
Life is the saddest song
But it was nothing until you came along
'Cause every road that I've been on
Leads me back to you
Leads me back to you
It leads me back to you
I sold a million line before I came to you
Guess none of us could read the lie behind the golden truth
Trust can't be counted on
It's as crooked as the Amazon
'Cause every road that I've been on
Leads me back to you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It leads me back to you
I've been looking for trouble, trouble
I've been looking for trouble, trouble (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've been looking for trouble, trouble
I'm looking for you
I walked a million miles before I came to you
Heaven wide above my head, sand beneath my shoes
Life is the saddest song
But it was nothing until you came along
'Cause every road that I've been on
Leads me back to you
Leads me back to you (yeah, yeah, yeah...)
Leads me back to you (yeah, yeah...)
Every road that I've been on
Leads me back to you
