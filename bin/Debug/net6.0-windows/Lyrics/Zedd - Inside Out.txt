We stayed up all night
Talking to each other, whispers under covers
You told me your life
Wasn't always easy, I said I know the feeling
I told you all about the scar on my shoulder
And you told me you're terrified of getting older
We stayed up all night
The first night of a million more 'cause
I'm gonna love you, love you inside out
I'm gonna love you, love you inside out
Nothing you say is gonna scare me now
Still gonna love you, love you inside out
I'm gonna love you, love you inside out
I'm gonna love you, love you inside out
Nothing you say is gonna scare me now
Still gonna love you, love you inside out
Oh-oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, inside out
We laughed 'til we cried
Made fun of each other, lost in one another
You held me so tight
And it felt like I was home, just the two of us alone
You said you don't wanna end up like your parents
I said, "Don't you worry, I'm not gonna let us"
We stayed up all night
The first night of a million more 'cause
I'm gonna love you, love you inside out
I'm gonna love you, love you inside out
Nothing you say is gonna scare me now
Still gonna love you, love you inside out
Oh-oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, inside out
So what do you say, babe?
'Cause I wanna know, oh
Can I be there babe
Through your highs and lows? Yeah
When the lights come off and the night is done
Everybody's left, can I be the one?
If it's all I do
I'm gonna love you, love you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I'm gonna love you babe, yeah
I'm gonna love you babe
I'm gonna love you, love you inside out (inside out)
I'm gonna love you, love you inside out (oh)
Nothing you say is gonna scare me now
Still gonna love you, love you inside out (from the inside out)
