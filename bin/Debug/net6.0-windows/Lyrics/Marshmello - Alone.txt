I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
You-you-you-you, you-you-you-you
You-you-you-you, you-you-you-you
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
You-you-you-you, you-you-you-you
You-you-you-you, you-you-you-you
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
